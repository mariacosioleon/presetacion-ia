This directory contains the source files for the latest version of
the LaTeX lecture slides for AIMA2e. These are current as of December 2004.

Postscript files (both full-size and 6-per-page for hardcopy) are
in the slides-ps directory; pdfs are in slides-pdf.

To make your own versions, copy the entire slides-tex directory (and
its subdirectories) to your own machine. Run
   latex chapterNN.tex
where NN is the chapter number, followed by
   dvips -o chapterNN.ps -t landscape chapterNN
to make the postscript file.

The "publish" file contains the full sequence of commands for
producing one particular chapter's slides, including the
6-per-page version.
