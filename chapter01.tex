\heading{Acting humanly: The Turing test}

Turing (1950) ``Computing machinery and intelligence'':\\
\blob ``\txm{Can machines think}?'' $\longrightarrow$ ``\txg{Can machines behave intelligently}?''\\
\blob Operational test for intelligent behavior: the \defn{Imitation Game}

\vspace*{-0.2in}

\blob Predicted that by 2000, a machine might have a 30\% chance of\al
     fooling a lay person for 5 minutes\\
\blob Anticipated all major arguments against AI in following 50 years\\
\blob Suggested major components of AI: knowledge, reasoning, language\al
     understanding, learning\\[0.1in]
Problem: Turing test is not \emph{reproducible}, \emph{constructive}, or\\
amenable to \emph{mathematical analysis}

%%%%%%%%%%%% Slide %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\heading{Thinking humanly: Cognitive Science}	

1960s ``\defn{cognitive revolution}'': information-processing psychology replaced\\
prevailing orthodoxy of \defn{behaviorism}

Requires scientific theories of internal activities of the brain\al
 -- What level of abstraction? ``\note{Knowledge}'' or ``\note{circuits}''?\al
 -- How to validate? Requires \nl
    1) Predicting and testing behavior of human subjects (top-down)\nl
    or 2) Direct identification from neurological data (bottom-up)

Both approaches (roughly, \txm{Cognitive Science} and \txb{Cognitive Neuroscience}) \\
are now distinct from AI

Both share with AI the following characteristic:\al
   \emph{the available theories do not explain (or engender)\al
   anything resembling human-level general intelligence}

Hence, all three fields share one principal direction!



%%%%%%%%%%%% Slide %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\heading{Thinking rationally: Laws of Thought}

\defn{Normative} (or \defn{prescriptive}) rather than \note{descriptive}

Aristotle: what are correct arguments/thought processes?

Several Greek schools developed various forms of \defn{logic}:\al
   \emph{notation} and \emph{rules of derivation} for thoughts;\\
may or may not have proceeded to the idea of mechanization

Direct line through mathematics and philosophy to modern AI

Problems: \\
1) Not all intelligent behavior is mediated by logical deliberation\\
2) \note{What is the purpose of thinking}? What thoughts \emph{should} I have\al
   out of all the thoughts (logical or otherwise) that I \emph{could} have?



%%%%%%%%%%%% Slide %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\heading{Acting rationally}

\defn{Rational} behavior: doing the right thing

The right thing: that which is expected to maximize goal achievement,\\
given the available information

Doesn't necessarily involve thinking---e.g., blinking reflex---but\\
thinking should be in the service of rational action

Aristotle (Nicomachean Ethics):\al
  \emph{Every art and every inquiry, and similarly every  \al
       action and pursuit, is thought to aim at some good}


%%%%%%%%%%%% Slide %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\heading{Rational agents}

An \defn{agent} is an entity that perceives and acts

This course is about designing \defn{rational agents}

Abstractly, an agent is a function from percept histories to actions:
\[f: {\cal P}^* \rightarrow {\cal A}\]
For any given class of environments and tasks, we seek the\\
agent (or class of agents) with the best performance

Caveat: \emph{computational limitations make \nl
\ \ perfect rationality unachievable}\\
$\rightarrow$ design best \note{program} for given machine resources

\heading{Unintentionally funny stories}


One day Joe Bear was hungry. He asked his friend Irving Bird where some
honey was. Irving told him there was a beehive in the oak tree. Joe threatened
to hit Irving if he didn't tell him where some honey was. The End.

Henry Squirrel was thirsty. He walked over to the river bank where his
good friend Bill Bird was sitting. Henry slipped and fell in the
river. Gravity drowned. The End.

Once upon a time there was a dishonest fox and a vain crow. One day the
crow was sitting in his tree, holding a piece of cheese in his mouth. He
noticed that he was holding the piece of cheese. He became hungry, and
swallowed the cheese. The fox walked over to the crow. The End.
